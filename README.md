# 2022 Menyuan earthquake
## Providing 2022 Menyuan seismic fault models derived from geodetic observations and seismic parameter inversion

> Two earthquakes struck Menyuan, Qinghai province in Northwest China: Mw 5.9 event on 26 January 2016 and Mw 6.7 event on 8 January 2022. The interferometric synthetic radar (InSAR) technique was utilized to retrieve high resolution co-seismic surface displacement maps for both events. 

> The co-seismic surface displacements were then inverted to determine the fault geometry parameters and the non-uniform fault slip distributions with a dislocation model in an elastic half-space.

> Our results are shared here, including distributed fault sliding models for the 2016 Menyuan Earthquake and the 2022 Menyuan Earthquake.
 
> The data format is **“lon(deg)  lat(deg) str(deg)   dip(deg)   dep(km)  wid(km) leng(km) s_slip(m) d_slip(m) o_slip(m)”**
